This package installs an checkbox attribute for pages that lets you mark a page type. Now whenever a page of this type is published, this will trigger the submission of this page to different social networks via their API. This way, any publishing of a blog post, an event or anything else you associate the attribute with will automatically be tweeted from your account.

## Installation
You need to run composer install to make this package work. For more information visit getcomposer.org.

## Credentials
To make use of this Package, you need API Keys for the different Social Networks which you must obtain yourself. Only those services for whom the keys are provided will be used for publishing.
